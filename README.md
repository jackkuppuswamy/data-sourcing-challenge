# Movie Recommendation System for reviews and related movies
## Overview
This project extracts movie related data from The New York Times API and The Movie Database, and then merges relevant data to recommend movies along with their reviews and related movies.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Pandas Library
* API Keys for New York Times and The Movie Database
* Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

## Setup
1. Clone the Repository:

    [[git clone https://github.com/jackkuppuswamy/data-sourcing-challenge.git](https://github.com/jackkuppuswamy/data-sourcing-challenge.git))

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

    cd data-sourcing-challenge

3. Run the Application:

    Start Jupyter Notebook and open the retrieve_movie_data.ipynb file to interactively run the data retrieval scripts to get movie details from New York Times API and The Movie Database API, and then merge and clean the data for exporting the data to CSV for movie recommendation.

    If you would like to retrieve different set of movie list, you can change the query parameters in "Access the New York Times API" section and execute the script again to get the updated output in "movies_list.csv" file in Output folder.
